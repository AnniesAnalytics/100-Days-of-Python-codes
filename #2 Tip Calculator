Todayâ€™s challenge is to split a bill, including tip, between friends. 

total = input("Welcome to the tip calculator. What was the total bill? $")
number_of_people = input("How many people to split the bill? ")
tip_percent = input("What percentage would you like to tip? ")
#get our inputs
total_as_num= float(total)
num_people_as_num = int(number_of_people)
#convert type
tip_on_100 = int(tip_percent)/100+1
#get the tip total
total_per_person = (total_as_num/num_people_as_num)*tip_on_100
what_to_pay= round(total_per_person,2)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${what_to_pay}.")

->

Welcome to the tip calculator. What was the total bill? $150.5
How many people to split the bill? 4
What percentage would you like to tip? 20
Each person should pay $45.15.
